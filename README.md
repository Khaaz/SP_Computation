# Modelisation [SP]

+ **Category**: School Project
+ **Status**: Discontinued

## **Overview**

This project is a set of assignment we had to do for an introduction to computational problems class.  
We had to write algorithm to solve several computational problems (eg: Travelling Salesman Problem) in heuristic time. This class was about mathematical optimisation and modelisation.

All subjects and solution can be found directly in the repo. We learned about algorithm complexity, and all things related to computational mathematics (graphs, N, NP...).

## **Goal / Requirements**

The goal was to solve several problems with algorithms that would run in a specific time frame (max: 2 min).

Data were given in text files, and the results was ran through a test program (also in the repo) that would generate the output and test the validity.  
Grades were given related to that and to the time spent running the algorithm (faster the algorithm, the better the grade).

## **Technologies**

+ python
